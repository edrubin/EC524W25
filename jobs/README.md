# Jobs

A few people have asked me about jobsâ€”where to find them, how to prepare for them, etc. I'm trying to provide some concise but helpful resources here. Please let me know if I am missing anything important.

## Finding jobs

Job listings on centralized websites:

- **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/)**: The most popular professional networking site: search for jobs, connect with people in your field, and more.
- **[Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/)**: A popular job search engine.
- **[USAJobs](https://www.usajobs.gov/)**: US federal government jobs (including government agencies like Forest Service, NASA, NOAA, etc.)
- **[Handshake](https://app.joinhandshake.com/)**: Job listings for students and recent graduates.
- State government websites, for example, [Oregon](https://oregon.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com/SOR_External_Career_Site)

Individual employers also list jobs, e.g., [Amazon](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/). To get an idea of which employers hire economists, it may help to check out the American Economic Association's [job listing](https://www.aeaweb.org/joe/listings) ("JOE").

## UO resources

The University of Oregon has several resources:

- **[University Career Center](https://career.uoregon.edu/)**
- **[Advising in the College of Arts and Sciences](https://cas.uoregon.edu/advising/access-advising)**

## More

Don't be afraid to (respectfully) reach out to people who have jobs that interest you. You can ask them about the actual job and about the path that led them to the job (including any skills/preparation that would help en route).
